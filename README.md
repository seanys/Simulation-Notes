## Introduction

This repository mainly contains our notes about some examples of SimPy. It also contains teaching examples using Excel from Prof. Qiu Canhua and Prof. Hu Zhaolin. 

We also build a demo for airplane boarding based on SimPy. https://github.com/seanys/Boarding-Simulation

### Gas Station Refueling Example

> A gas station has a limited number of gas pumps that share a common fuel reservoir. Cars randomly arrive at the gas station, request one of the fuel pumps and start refueling from that reservoir. A gas station control process observes the gas station's fuel level and calls a tank truck for refueling if the station's level drops below a threshold.

### Process Communication
> This example shows how to interconnect simulation model elements together using :class : `~simpy.resources.store.Store` for one-to-one, and many-to-one asynchronous processes. For one-to-many a simpleBroadCastPipe class is constructed from Store.
